## FAQ

- Does this work with Hybrid Flasher / Updater POC?
  - No at the current time it will only function as expected on retail executables.
  - Please make sure you flash back to "Retail" or reinstall your Firmware before using.
- It does not Load!!??
  - Make sure you follow the instructions for loading the payload.
  - Right now it requires HEN or homebrew enabler to load it.
  - So far from my testing Mira & GoldHEN work but others do not.
- What firmware does this work with?
  - Currently it supports 5.05, 6.72, 7.02, 7.55 & 9.00
- How can I help with bugs?
  - Please submit a bug Issue on this repo. Please Insure to use the Bug Template.
  - For any bugs I will need a crash log in order to figure out the issue. The playstation error codes do not generally help.
